## Review
The provided submission outlines a step-by-step process for setting up a development environment with Visual Studio Code, VirtualBox, Ubuntu, GitHub, and AWS while also demonstrating screenshots for verification. However, upon review, there are concerns about the alignment with the instructor's requirements for grading purposes. Here's the evaluation:

## VS Code Installation Confirmation:

**Criteria:**  The instructor requested a valid screenshot of the Visual Studio Code welcome screen.
**Observation:** The provided "images/vscode.png" from the repository needs review. If the screenshot shows the actual VS Code welcome screen, it would score 20/25. However, this cannot be verified without explicitly seeing the image against the instructor's clear stipulation.
Score Assigned: Unable to fully verify without the image content; provisional score 0/25.

## Git Installation Confirmation:

**Criteria:** Valid terminal output of the git --version command.
**Observation:** The document claims to have an image verifying Git installation in "images/git.png". Without direct assessment, this cannot be evaluated.
Score Assigned: Conditional 0/25 due to lack of access to explicitly verify.
VirtualBox Installation Confirmation:

**Criteria:**  A screenshot of the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager welcome screen.
**Observation:** "images/virtual-box.png" is mentioned, but its alignment with the specified welcome screen is indistinct due to text-only submission.
Score Assigned: Provisional 0/25 pending proper verification against the instructor's criteria.
Ubuntu Installation Confirmation within VirtualBox:

**Criteria:** Valid screenshot inside VirtualBox showing Ubuntu login prompt.
**Observation:** "images/ubuntu.png" is provided. Its verification as Ubuntu login prompt is again indeterminate from text.
**Score Assigned:** 0/25, provisionally rejected until direct image review.

## Additional Aspects:

GitHub account setup and AWS account setup documentation might align with the instructor's requirements, but these aspects were contingent on proper screenshot verification.

In summary, no direct confirmation of images matching prescribed screenshots can be provided, leading to a provisional grading decision.

Overall Final Score: 0/100 (all criteria unfulfilled without robust screenshot validation).
